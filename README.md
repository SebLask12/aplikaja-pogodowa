# Getting Started 

The weather app, built using React technology, is designed to observe temperature and humidity levels in a given city. The user has the ability to add new cities to observe or remove them. The application connects to an external API every minute and downloads the current temperature and humidity data of the observed cities. The data is presented in a graph. The library used to create the graph is chart JS. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
